## Triggers and Nodes

#### Overview

By searching the keyword **“WOZTELL”** in the sidebar, you can access the list of available n8n nodes and triggers.

<img src="https://store.sanuker.cn/nn/images/image-20250829122639889.png" alt="image-20250829122639889" style="zoom:50%;" />

Within this list, you will find all nodes and triggers developed by WOZTELL for n8n. You may directly drag and drop the required node or trigger into the workflow designer to make it part of your workflow.

-  **Triggers**: These nodes enable you to receive all webhook message data coming from WOZTELL products.
-  **BOT API Actions**: These nodes provide your workflow with the ability to send messages and perform data operations through WOZTELL products.
-  **Member Actions**: These nodes allow you to efficiently manage all member information stored within WOZTELL products.



#### Webhook: On WOZTELL Message received

Through the **WOZTELL Trigger** node, you can receive webhook messages from any WOZTELL Channel, including various types such as *Inbound*, *Outbound*, and *Member Update*. Each message is delivered in JSON format and contains comprehensive data along with the associated event information.

![image-20250829122535949](https://store.sanuker.cn/nn/images/image-20250829122535949.png)

Within this node, you can specify the corresponding **Webhook Path** and configure filtering options based on **Channel ID** and **Event Type**, ensuring that the information you receive is properly filtered and can be utilized effectively.

![image-20250826184406024](https://store.sanuker.cn/nn/images/image-20250826184406024.png)



#### Node: Send Response

Using the **Send Response** node, you can directly send messages from your WhatsApp Business number to the target customer’s WhatsApp account via the WOZTELL BotAPI. All message content can be placed directly within the Response data.

Once the message is sent, you will receive the corresponding API result, which allows subsequent nodes to continue processing the data.

For more details, please refer to the official WOZTELL product documentation: [https://doc.woztell.com/docs/reference/bot-api-reference#send-responses](https://doc.woztell.com/docs/reference/bot-api-reference#send-responses)

![sendResponse](https://store.sanuker.cn/nn/images/sendResponse.png)



#### Node: Redirect member to node

With the **Redirect Member to Node** node, you no longer need to manually construct complex JSON data for sending messages. Instead, you simply pass the relevant WOZTELL information to a **Chatbot Tree** node, and the WOZTELL Chatbot will handle the subsequent actions for you — such as sending WhatsApp conversation message templates.

This node can be understood as a memory pointer: it redirects the current operation to the WOZTELL Chatbot. You do not need to prepare complicated data structures; you only need to initiate a request to the BotAPI.

For customers who already have chatbot designs running on the WOZTELL platform, this provides an excellent way to integrate with n8n.

![redirectMemberToNode](https://store.sanuker.cn/nn/images/redirectMemberToNode.png)

#### Node: Send WhatsApp Template message

According to WhatsApp’s official business messaging guidelines, when contacting unfamiliar WhatsApp numbers or numbers outside the 24-hour session window, you must first send a **WhatsApp Template Message**.

Our n8n plugin significantly simplifies the complexity of working with WhatsApp Template Messages. The current node can automatically generate the required message content based on templates that have already been created and approved. You only need to complete the corresponding form fields, and the Template Message can be sent directly.
